#### A hangry bunny
Benny, the Bunny is hungry!
But hungry not for any food, he's craving **for** apple pie!

There's an apple tree in the woods with apples falling all the time, what a waste!

Sooooo, Benny decided to grab his fruit basket and head towards that tree to collect them and make his precious & delish Apple Pie! :3

### Game Rules
* Start the game by pressing **'spacebar'**
* Move the basket using **left** and **right** arrow keys of your keyboard
* Try to collect as many as possible, we need at least 25 apples!
#### BEWARE!
* There's a witch in the forest who doesn't like Benny and will try to poison him by putting poisoned apples along the normal ones.
* Avoid catching them at all costs or the game will end!
